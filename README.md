## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a student at the University of Michigan pursuing a BSE in Computer Science. My academic journey has fuelled a profound interest in software development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning domains. Actively pursuing opportunities to apply my academic knowledge, I am particularly proficient in code development, specializing in both C++ and Python. Whether it is engineering solutions or deciphering datasets, I am committed to significantly contributing to the tech landscape. I am looking for opportunities to apply my coding and analytical skills to real-world projects, further honing my abilities and gaining valuable industry experience.
